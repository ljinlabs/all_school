# All School

## Gist
Courses in UIUC have multiple platforms for students to use.
While the variety of platform fulfills different requirements and needs for different classes, it is a tremendous hassle for students (especially this semester since everything is online.)

All School is focuses on five main categories
- Schedule
- Homework / Assignments
- Forums
- Lectures / Discussions
- Labs

For each course and for each semester, users can add a course either for themselves or to be shared on public. If shared on public, the aggregated table can be viewed by other people.

### Dev notes (What I want it to do)

- log in: just set up simple oauth or maybe allow illinois login
- search pre-created course aggregates by semesters
- add courses if none exists
- decide to make the course aggre public or private

- Unless the user archives the aggre, the aggregated course will disappear if not current. Why? just cuz.
